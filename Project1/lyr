  //so let me tell you niggas about nu nihilism 
  //transmitting thru the prism of truth actin as our prison 
  //can't escape it cuz its a mother fucking syllogism  
  //of right and wrong being wrought upon our f system. 

  //Its the coevolution...of truth and power
  //standing at the crossroads to sieze whats ours 
  //to enforce it we'll stand in opposition to the norm 
  //to homogenize life, to enforce what we think is uniform. 

  //its a natural tendency to abdicate responsibility 
  //spout philosophy, and go.
  //But little do we know that its possible to show
  //things getting lost in the ebb and flow. 

  //What we fail to see, is all the complexity, that reality makes us resent
  //We reduce, simplify, fractionalize, until everything we know is spent. 
  //But why fucking care, since humanity is rare, why does it matter at all
  //Cant change it, figure it, twist it, configure it, so why not just let it fall

  //This is the age of nu fucking nihilism 
  //This is the end all the fucking syllogisms 
  //This is the end of all academia 
  //So Lets just get up and make some noise
